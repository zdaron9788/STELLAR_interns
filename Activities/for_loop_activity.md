# For Loop Group Activity


## Code Directions:
1. Switch typer every 10 minutes!
2. Write an iterating loop to open/dl each target's light curve files
3. Open these files inside the loop and don't forget to make them light curve objects (not files)
4. Plot each light curve per sector
5. Make sure you can track which light curve belongs to which target
6. Can you also make the loop print the target id or sector the data comes from?
7. Be prepared to present how you did this in code!


## Presentation Directions:
1. You only need 1-2 slides
2. Show your code & figures
3. Total presentation should be ~5-7 minutes
4. Everyone needs to speak about a different part of the code  !!!
5. Each person can talk about what the code is doing OR a challenge AND how you solved it
6. Decide the order of speakers and organize your slide(s) in that order too
7. Focus on explaining what the code is doing for our science, not a line by line 
 description of the code (ex: We defined a new variable here because we changed the type of
 our data from a lightcurvefile object to a lightcurve object to access the data values 
 VS. We defined a new variable because we applied an attribute)
